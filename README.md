# Paginaton-photo-slider
A responsive image slider with caption animations, auto slide functionality and pagination using QuickCodingTuts as a reference.
In this project I learned a lot about Javascript such as using for each loops to remove active classes, how to add captions with Js, and how to set intervals for animations and automatic sliding.
Something else of importance I learned was that Js animations must be removed in order to be used again.
